# Experiment Scripts

This folder contains simulation/conversion helpers used by notebooks under `experiment/notebooks`.

- `simulate_msprime_to_psmcfa.py`: simulate demographic model and write `psmcfa`
- `simulate_msprime_to_mhs.py`: simulate demographic model and write official `multihetsep/mhs`
- `run_supplementary.py`: generate supplementary S1-S5 figures/tables (CLI runner)

These scripts are experiment utilities (not end-user CLI surface).
